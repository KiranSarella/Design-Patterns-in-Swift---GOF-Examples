/*
 No longer is the Singleton class responsible for creating the singleton. Instead, its primary responsibility is to make the singleton object of choice accessible in the system.
 
 The static object approach still has a potential drawbackâ€”namely that instances of all possible Singleton subclasses must be created, or else they won't get registered.
